# Bagels---Python-Game
Bagels is a deduction game where any digit number is set ( usually 3 digit numbers ) and you have to try to guess the mystery number within a certain amount of guesses.
After each guess, the game provides you with a clue about your guess: 
- Bagels = none of the digits you guessed are correct.
- Pico = only one digit is correct but it is in the wrong place.
- Fermi = your guess has a correct digit in the correct spot
